## So, it work for my machine!
I adopt libraries developed by others and put some icing and topping to suit my own use case. 
As stated in the title, it works on my machine and my own use case. I would love to hear that my work actually help you. 
However, if you ran into troubles as you apply them to your project, please go ahead and check with the authors of those libraries.
